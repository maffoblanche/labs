    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script:

    python main.py

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Load and Explore the Dataset:

Import the dataset and explore its structure. Check for missing data, outliers, and irrelevant features.
Time-Series Data Handling:

Ensure that the traffic data is sorted chronologically.
Convert time-based features (e.g., hour, day of the week) into numerical values or categorical variables.
Weather Data Integration:

Merge the traffic data with weather information, ensuring that both datasets are aligned in terms of time and location.
Feature Engineering:

Extract additional features from the timestamp, such as the hour of the day, weekday/weekend, or rush hour periods.
Process and normalize weather data to ensure it is on the same scale as traffic data. Handle missing values appropriately.
Create lag features to capture historical traffic data (e.g., traffic flow from the previous hour, previous day) to help the model predict future congestion patterns.
Scale the features (especially traffic flow) using Min-Max scaling or Standardization to ensure the neural network can learn effectively.

Model Building and Training
Neural Network Architecture:

Build a neural network model suitable for sequential data. A simple Fully Connected Network (FCN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), such as an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), can be used for handling time-series data.
Input layer: Features from the traffic data, weather data, and time-related features.
Hidden layers: At least two hidden layers with activation functions such as ReLU.
Output layer: A regression output (traffic congestion level or flow prediction).
Model Compilation:

Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function, as this is a regression problem.
Choose an optimizer like Adam for efficient training.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train the model using the training data. Monitor the training and validation loss to check for overfitting or underfitting.
After training, evaluate the model using the test set. Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE to assess model performance.
Use the trained model to predict traffic congestion for future time periods based on the features provided (time of day, weather conditions, etc.).

Real-Time Predictions
Fetch Live Data:

Use an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data.
Preprocess Live Data:

Convert live data to DataFrame and preprocess similarly to the training data.
Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to make real-time predictions based on the live data.
Visualization
Visualize Traffic Predictions:

Plot the predicted vs. actual traffic flow or congestion levels over time to visually assess the accuracy of the model.
Use Matplotlib to create time series plots showing the predicted traffic congestion levels for the next few hours or days.
Weather vs. Traffic Flow Visualization:

Create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) and traffic flow or congestion.
Expected Outcomes
Model Performance:

Learn how to build and evaluate a neural network for sequential data forecasting, particularly for traffic prediction.
Impact of Time and Weather:

Observe the influence of different time-based features (e.g., rush hours, weekdays) and weather conditions (e.g., rain, temperature) on traffic congestion.

Additional Challenges
Spatial Data Integration:

Integrate spatial data (e.g., traffic flow from multiple locations or intersections in Yaoundé) to predict congestion across the entire city, not just a single point.
Real-Time Predictions:

Modify the model to predict traffic congestion in real-time by incorporating live data from traffic sensors or weather APIs.
Assessment Criteria
Report Submission:

Submit a detailed report including:
Data preprocessing steps and feature engineering strategies.
Evaluation metrics and analysis of model performance.
Visualizations and insights from the prediction results.
Model Optimization:

Demonstrate improvements in model performance through hyperparameter tuning or different model architectures.
